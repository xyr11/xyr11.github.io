He enjoys programming and web development in his free time, along with taking pictures and playing video games. His interest started when he was in 6th(?<!--I forgot lol-->) grade when he was first introduced to HTML and has grown interest in programming ever since. He has a basic knowledge and understanding of C++, Javascript, and Nodejs, and is skilled at front-end stuff with HTML and CSS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-did-you-start-this\">Why did you start this?</h2>\n<p>Long-term dream as a kid, short-term rushed CS assignment that doesn't deserve the rush so that's why I'm continuing it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-the-name\">Why the name?</h2>\n<p>Funny story actually. At my school, one of the perks given is having a GitHub Student Developer Pack, of which I can choose and own one of the selection of domains for free... for 1 year. <i>and yada yada yada</i>, I found xyr.codes and gladly took it.

Why? Because creating a site isn't just about creating the content of that site, but the location of it is one of the important things too.
