Basically, they're the stuff that you see when you embed them to social media.</p>\n        <h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementing them to the site that makes sites</h2>\n        <h3 id=\"implementation-html-part\">The HTML part</h3>\n        <p>Add a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> for each required info, something like this:</p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample long\">&lt;h1&gt;A site that makes sites&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Input&lt;/th&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Title only&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Location&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Date&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;date&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Content&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;</textarea>\n        <p>Add a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> to trigger the JavaScript that we're gonna be using and another <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> at the end to display the output: </p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample medium\">&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;button onclick=&quot;makeTheSite()&quot;&gt;Click here to generate the site!&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Output: &lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;textarea id=&quot;output&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</textarea>\n        <p>At this point, the JavaScript part is the only thing left before this is fully functional. The CSS is up to you! (I suggest learning and using <code>display: flex</code> to replace the table.)</p>\n        <h3 id=\"implementation-js-part\">The JavaScript Part</h3>\n        <p>To get started, create a function. It should have the same name as the one in the <code>onclick</code> part of the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> placed earlier. All the stuff will be placed inside the function.</p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample medium\">function makeTheSite() {\n  // stuff will go inside here.\n}</textarea>\n        <p>To get the values inside the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, we'll be using <code>document.getElementById('id-of-the-textarea')</code>.</p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample medium\">var description = document.getElementById('description').value;\nvar title = document.getElementById('title').value;\nvar location = document.getElementById('location').value;\nvar date = document.getElementById('date').value;\nvar content = document.getElementById('content').value;</textarea>\n        <p>Then, create a variable that essentially acts as a template and add the values of the previous variables to it. Use backticks(<code>``</code>) instead of quotes(<code>''</code> or <code>&quot;&quot;</code>) on adding values so that it's easier to manage (you won't need to add <code>\n</code> on every newline & you can add variables by using <code>${variable-name}</code>).</p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample long\">var Output = `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;${title} || YourSiteName&trade;&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;${description}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;${description}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;${title}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;${description}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ADD STUFF HERE --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- for example:\n    &lt;link href=&quot;${location}main.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\n    if your file is inside a folder, location = &quot;../&quot;\n  --&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ADD STUFF HERE --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- for example:\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;${location}index.html&quot;&gt;YourSiteName&trade;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n    if your file is inside a folder, location = &quot;../&quot;\n  --&gt;\n  &lt;main&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;${title}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;${date}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;article&gt;${content}&lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ADD STUFF HERE --&gt;\n\&lt;\/body&gt;\n\&lt;\/html&gt;`</textarea>\n        <p>To output the <code>Output</code> variable, we'll be replacing the value of the output textarea by doing the <code>document.getElementById().value</code> thing but in reverse:</p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample\">document.getElementById('output').value = Output</textarea>\n        <h3 id=\"the-location-variable\">The <code>location</code> variable</h3>\n        <p>You're probably confused about how the <code>location</code> variable works. Let me explain.</p>\n        <p>Let's say that for example, your site is inside a folder. Here, the location should have a value of \"<code>../</code>\". Let's also say that you have a <code>main.css</code> stylesheet but in the root folder. To access that folder in the template, all you have to do is put <code>href=&quot;${location}main.css&quot;</code> in the JavaScript part. You won't ever need to proofread the generated file anymore!</p>\n        <h3 id=\"complete-implementation\">Complete implementation</h3>\n        <p>You can copy the complete code below or <a href=\"../../../files/download/site-maker.html\" download>you can download the full HTML version here</a>.</p>\n        <textarea class=\"codeSample long\">&lt;h1&gt;A site that makes sites&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;!-- This is where you add the values of your site --&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th&gt;Input&lt;/th&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Title only&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Location&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Date&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;date&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;Content&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;\n      &lt;textarea id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n    &lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;!-- This is where the output goes when the button is clicked --&gt;\n&lt;!-- Click this button to generate the site --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;button onclick=&quot;makeTheSite()&quot;&gt;Click here to generate the site!&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Output: &lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;textarea id=&quot;output&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- This is JavaScript part where magic happens --&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n// When you click the button, you are triggering this function\n  function makeTheSite() {\n    // Get the values on the &lt;textareas&gt;\n    var description = document.getElementById('description').value;\n    var title = document.getElementById('title').value;\n    var location = document.getElementById('location').value;\n    var date = document.getElementById('date').value;\n    var content = document.getElementById('content').value;\n    // This the template of your site\n    // REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE STUFF HERE ACCORDING TO STUFF ON YOUR SITE!\n    var Output = `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;${title} || YourSiteName&trade;&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;${description}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;${description}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;${title}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;${description}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ADD STUFF HERE --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- for example:\n    &lt;link href=&quot;${location}main.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\n    if your file is inside a folder, location = &quot;../&quot;\n  --&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ADD STUFF HERE --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- for example:\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;${location}index.html&quot;&gt;YourSiteName&trade;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n    if your file is inside a folder, location = &quot;../&quot;\n  --&gt;\n  &lt;main&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;${title}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;${date}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;article&gt;${content}&lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ADD STUFF HERE --&gt;\n\&lt;\/body&gt;\n\&lt;\/html&gt;`\n  // output the Output variable\n  document.getElementById('output').value = Output\n  }\n// end of the magic\n&lt;/script&gt;</textarea>\n        <p>Remember to customize the <code>Output</code> variable and add your own CSS!</p>",footer:"Did you know that this website is responsive?"},
