        <p>It's very amazing to look at the video because of the fact that I compressed 2.5 hours of work into a 3 minute video.</p>
        <p>This is the second speed edit on my channel for my assignment in our Health 3 subject about Human Sexuality.</p>
        <p>Take note that some parts have been cut off for the sake of time. Would you like a 10 minute-long video just on speed editing? Probably not.</p>
