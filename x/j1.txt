          <p>
            A painful thought as he foretold <br>
            Still lingering last yesterday <br>
            I’m getting on and getting gold <br>
            I’ll just do work, no time to play
          </p>
          <p>
            Regrettably, you need to go <br>
            You should have your own self-control <br>
            A fact you should know: “time’s your foe” <br>
            Get good grades for graduation roll
          </p>
          <p>
            For every second of our life <br>
            The value of them is precious gold <br>
            (You) concentrate and use your time <br>
            So tomorrow you’ll be strong and bold
          </p>
          <p>
            Like everyone on planet earth <br>
            (You) concentrate; now and henceforth
          </p>
