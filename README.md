# XYR.codes
This is XYR.codes, the official webpage of Xyrus Kurt Roldan in the depths of the internet! Here, you can find stuff I make on the internet ranging from coding projects to blogging and photography.

+ `dev` is the development branch which mainly adds features and fixes.

## Other stuff I guess

### Why did you start this?
Long-term dream as a kid, short-term rushed CS assignment that doesn't deserve the rush so that's why I'm finishing it

### Why the name? / Aren't you hosting it already at <https://xyr11.github.io>?
Funny story actually. On my school, one of the perks given is having a GitHub Student Developer Pack, of which I can choose and own one of the selection of domains for free... for 1 year. *and yada yada yada*, I found `xyr.codes` and gladly took it. So that's why I (for now) have 2 urls of the site.
