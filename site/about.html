        <p>This is XYR.codes, the official webpage of Xyrus Kurt Roldan in the depths of the internet! Here, you can find stuff I make on the internet ranging from coding projects to blogging and photography.</p>
        <!-- This is an older description ;)
          <p>[<i>Formerly</i>], this site is a Computer Science 3 project that is being actively developed by Xyrus Roldan for completion of the said course and (more recently) has evolved to encompass for his personal use.</p>
        -->
        <h3 id="about-the-creator">About the creator</h3>
        <p>Xyrus Kurt Roldan is a student and a self-confessed programming addict, but he is still new in the programming world. He enjoys programming and web developing in his free time, along with taking pictures and playing video games. His interest started when he was in 6th(?<!--I forgot lol-->) grade when he was first introduced in HTML and has grown interest to programming ever since. He has a basic knowledge and understanding of C++, Javascript and Nodejs, and is skilled at front-end stuff with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h3 id="why-did-you-start-this">Why did you start this?</h3>
        <p>Long-term dream as a kid, short-term rushed CS assignment that doesn't deserve the rush so that's why I'm continuing it.</p>
        <h3>Why the name?</h3>
        <p>Funny story actually. On my school, one of the perks given is having a GitHub Student Developer Pack, of which I can choose and own one of the selection of domains for free... for 1 year. <i>and yada yada yada</i>, I found xyr.codes and gladly took it. So that's why I (for now) have 2 urls of the site.</p>
        <h3 id="contribute-stuff">Contribute stuff</h3>
        <p>This project is now on GitHub! <a href="https://github.com/xyr11/xyr11.github.com">Check the repository.</a></p>
